# Buttermilk Cornbread

Lots and Lots of calories around 2400, but delicious. I tried this
for the first time in August 2017.

### Ingredients

 - 150g Cornmeal
 - 50g Cup Flour
 - 30g Sugar
 - 1/2 Teaspoon Baking Powder
 - 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
 - 1 Eggs
 - 60g Butter
 - 70g Vegetable Oil
 - 150g Milk

 ### Directions
  1. Combine dry ingredients
  2. Melt Butter
  3. Beat eggs well
  4. Combine wet ingredients and mix
  5. Combine everything
  6. Grease pan
  7. Pour batter
  8. Bake at 180C until stick comes out clean circa 15min
  9. Pout melted butter over top.

  ### Notes

  - Flour makes it cake-like. Avoid. Add more cornmeal if you want to
    thicken it.

  - The original recipe called for 100g sugar, but it was too sweet, almost
    cake like. I reduced it to 30g.
