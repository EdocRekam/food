# Buttermilk Biscuits #

This is still an experimental recipe.

### Ingredients

- 115g Butter
- 300g Low protein flour
- 240g Buttermilk
- 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder
- 1 Teaspoon Salt

### Directions

 1. Grate butter to small chunks, put in freezer.
 2. Mix frozen butter and flour in mixing bowl.
 3. Add buttermilk
 4. Mix just until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.
 5. Roll out dough and fold five times or more.
 6. Doug should be about 2.5 cm thick
 7. Cut and put on baking sheet.
 8. Bake at 250C for 15 minutes.
 9. Brush on melted butter on the tops.

### Notes

 - The biscuits should touch on the backing sheet so they help each other rise.

 - Biscuits should be light and fluffy so we don't want a lot of gluten, that
   means you should use a low protein flour. Maybe try using cake flour?

 - We do not want the butter melt into the flour, small frozen chunks is what
   we want. So make sure your mixing bowl, and buttermilk is cold and freeze
   the butter.

 - You can try rasping or grating the butter while frozen to reach the desired
   consistency.
