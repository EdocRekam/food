Add one a half grams of water for each gram of rice.

1. Wash rice. Rice starch is what makes it sticky. The more you wash the less
   it sticks.

2. Add rice and water to pot. Cover pot.

3. Bring water to boil quickly and then simmer for eight minutes. Do not
   adjitate the rice while cooking and do not lift lid.
