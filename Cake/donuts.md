# Glazed Donuts

May 2020. These are the best homemade donuts I've had to date. The original
recipe was almost perfect except for the nutmeg.

Makes 10 donuts with donut holes; otherwise 12 donuts.

### Base Ingredients

- 280g Flour
- 155g Water
-  40g Sugar
-  40g Butter
-  1.5 Tablespoon Milk Powder (1/2 Cup)
-  1.0 Tablespoon Egg Powder (1 Egg)
-  0.5 Teaspoon Salt
-  0.5 Packet Dried Yeast

### Directions

1. Knead dough in bread machine for ~10 minutes or hand knead for 15
   minutes.
2. Let dough rise to double volume
3. Roll out 1.5 centimeters with rolling pin
4. Cut shapes and place on parchment
5. Let dough rise until satisfied
6. Fry until golden brown at 160C
7. Coat in icing and leave on rack

### Notes

> Placing dough on parchment paper and then sliding it into the
> hot oil makes it easy to maintain the fragile donut shape.

> I used an larger Ikea drinking glass for the outer diameter and a small
> mortar for the whole.
